arm cpu
ml based algorithsm running on embedded system
its actually gesture recogntion
tie up with 3rd party
qc for gpu and models
bosch and lg for camera integration
currently next gen software with more use cases.
car line release is fixed& released in media so we plan accordingly

ml based Project, camera based project, driver, passenger are sitting
detect hand and other movement, track hand movement, 
certain use cases are triggered - like UI icons
comfort, safety-child seat occupant-adult, empty, child

AP-TEAM: we get images from camera, scale to lower resolution, model given to us,
load the model, test,
send to next module with xyz which triggers the use case.

linux based, arm cpu cross compiled with 
interact with cpu,gpu 

constraint: finish it in 37ms
parallel processing, optimised code based, cpu target, memory target.
